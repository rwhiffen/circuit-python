# circuit-python
Where I put my circuit python stuff

All of these projects are from AdaFruit.com.

* Hallowwing-lightshow - just the 5.3 uf2 file for now
* PyPortal_OpenWeather - Just the code right from the pyPortal example project - [https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-weather-station](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-weather-station)
* bluefruit - again just the uf2 file for the demo app for a [Circuit Plaground BlueFruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit)
* clue - demo app for temp and humidity sensor - [Adafruit CLUE](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue)
* kitty-paw - A [qtPy RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4900) app from this [learning guide - Kitty Toe Bean Keypad](https://learn.adafruit.com/kitty-toe-bean-paw-keypad-color-tct) - basically a 4 button macro pad that displays images.  No real changes to the base code other than the image being of my cat instead of the parrot.
* lightsaber - The adafruit [feather M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) and [propmaker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988) code for this [LightSaber build project](https://learn.adafruit.com/lightsaber-featherwing). There's a [kit with wires and such](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4860) that make it a lot easier to build.
* magtag - again demo app for a adafruit [Magtag](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4800) - running the [Daily Weather Forcast](https://learn.adafruit.com/magtag-weather) code
* eyelights-music - another demo app for Adabox 20 - [Eye Glasses and LED driver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyelights-led-glasses-and-driver) - running the [Music-Reactive Lights](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyelights-led-glasses-and-driver/music-reactive-lights) example code - doubt I'll ever do much with this
