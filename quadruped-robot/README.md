my attempt at Ronald Jaramillo Simple 3D printable quadruped robot, driven by 8 servos and a microcontroller.

Ronald's github:
[https://github.com/Traverso/QuadrupedRobot](https://github.com/Traverso/QuadrupedRobot)

Going to try this with circuit python on an [Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995) and a [8-Channel PWM or Servo FeatherWing ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2928)

I have no idea how this is going to turn out. I just want the practice before I start trying to build an R2D2 droid.
