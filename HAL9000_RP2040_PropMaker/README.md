This is my copy/clone of the code (and stuff) from the AdaFruit learn guide:

[Talking HAL 9000 with RP2040 Prop Maker Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/hal-9000-rp2040-prop-maker/overview)

by the [Ruiz Brothers](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/pixil3d)

So you're better off going right to the source I don't think I'm going to make any substative changes/additions, I just wanted my own git copy to go with my workflow of how I organize my circuit python projects.
