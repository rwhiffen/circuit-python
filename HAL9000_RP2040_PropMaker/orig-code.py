HAL 9000 demo project for Adafruit Prop Maker Feather RP2040 and "Massive
Arcade Button with LED - 100mm red." This simply monitors for button presses
and then randomly plays one WAV file from the CIRCUITPY filesystem.
No soldering required; using quick-connects, LED and button can be wired
to screw terminals on the Prop Maker Feather board.
NOTE: WAV FILES MUST BE 16-BIT. This will be fixed (allowing 8-bit WAVs if
desired) in CircuitPython 9.0.

# HARDWARE SETUP -----------------------------------------------------------

# LED+ is wired to "Neo" pin on screw terminal header, LED- to GND.
# The LED inside the button is NOT a NeoPixel, just a normal passive LED,
# but that's okay here -- the "Neo" pin can also function like a simple
# 5V digital output or PWM pin.

# MAIN LOOP ----------------------------------------------------------------

# False) and then plays a random WAV file. Because the WAV-playing function
# will take a few seconds, this doesn't even require button debouncing.
